\begin{abstract}
An explanation of the single-lambda and multiple-lambda heuristic for PTP.
\end{abstract}

\section{Related Work}

The heuristic is based on a similar idea as the algorithm from Gulek et al.\cite{Gulek:2010:DPA:1838770.1839019} for the tree-like weighted set packing problem.

\section{Task Description}

Given a rooted fully binary tree with non-negative edge weight function $w$, we want to partition its leaves into disjoint sets (called species). The \emph{most recent common ancestors} (MRCA) of those species induce subtrees with edge sets $E_1, \ldots, E_{k}$. Every edge that is not assigned to one of those subtrees is then put into the set of speciation edges, $E_{k+1}$.

Given a set of edges $E$, we define its log-likelihood $logl(E)$ as
$$logl(E) := |E| * (\log{|E|} - 1 - \log{\sum_{e \in E} w(e)})$$

\paragraph{Multiple Lambda Score}

We want to find a delimitation such that the following sum of loglikelihoods (in the following referred to as \emph{score}) is maximized:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{logl(E_i)}$$

\paragraph{Single Lambda Score}

We want to find a delimitation such that the following sum of loglikelihoods (in the following referred to as \emph{score}, too) is maximized:

$$logl(\cup_{i=1}^k{E_i}) + logl(E_{k+1})$$

\section{General Idea}

We follow a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, always trying to extend a good solution for the children subtrees in order to obtain a good solution for the currently observed tree.

\subsection{Currently observed tree}

For each node $v$, the \emph{currently observed tree} consists of the subtree rooted at $v$, $S(v)$, and the set of edges where we already know that they have to be speciation edges in the case that a node in $S(v)$ is a speciation event. (see Fig.~\ref{fig:currently_observed_tree})

	\caption{The currently observed tree of $v$, marked with thick blue edges}
	\label{fig:currently_observed_tree}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Combination of solutions}

For every node, we store an array that contains the best found score for $0, 2, 4, \ldots$ speciation edges and the delimitation that led to it.

In order to find a solution for a subtree $S(v)$ and $k$ speciation edges, we combine the best found solution for $i$ speciation edges from the left child of $v$ with the best found solution for $j$ speciation edges for the right child of $v$ for all choices of $i$ and $j$ where $i+j+2$ sums up to $k$ and take the one that yields to the highest score (see Fig.~\ref{fig:combining}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/speciation_events.pdf}
\caption{Combining the best found solutions for the subtrees}
\label{fig:combining}
\end{figure}



If we have $0$ speciation edges in $S(v)$, it simply means that $v$ is handled as the root of a coalescent group (species). Thus we can directly use the score function to obtain this score and do not need to look at the children's scores.

\ldots

\section{Handling of zero-length Edges}

If the sum of edge-weights in a subtree is zero, its corresponding log-likelihood value would be infinity. Because this worsens the delimitation results a lot, we decide to treat this case differently.

Since a subtree with edge sum zero originates from identical sampled sequences, we shrink the whole subtree to a single node, thus reducing the total number of edges in the tree.

Other zero-length edges that may appear in the tree (e.g., for representing multifurcations) are not treated differently as they do not cause any problems.

(TODO: image with zero length edges)
